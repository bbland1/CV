## HTML Type CV May 2022

This was the first project in The App Brewery Udemy course https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/

This was built mmostly to undestand how HTML builds the intial words of the site. How to get the basic tags set up and to have mroe than one page. Simple Vanilla CSS was use for some basic styling to make it more than just white, and to work through the steps of connecting an external CSS stylesheet and changeing all the pages of the site.
